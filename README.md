# GetGifs

A new Flutter project.

### How to get started

 - install flutter from flutter.dev
 - run `flutter doctor -v` to ensure environment is set up appropriately
 - have either a physical device connected or an emulator open
 - open the application and run
 
### About

 - Flutter application that has one widget that contains an image and a button
 - Button triggers an api call to Giphy that retrieves an image url for a random gif
 - If you'd like to customize behavior, add your api key in and manage through the giphy developer dashboard
